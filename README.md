# Example Hybrids.js + React.js
Create reusable web-components using Hybrid.js + React.js frameworks

## Build
All React components are by default exported and hybridized into one bundle using `rollup.js`. Final js bundle with example HTML page is in the `/dist` folder.
```
npm run build
```

## Dev
Rollup.js takes care about serving static files and hot rebuild. Output source is unminified.
```
npm run dev
```
